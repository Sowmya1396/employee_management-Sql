# Employee Management SQL PROJECT
# Project Description
The project simulates HR and business scenarios, including department and job management, salary analysis, and employee data handling. It is designed to showcase SQL proficiency for data analysis and reporting purposes.
# Technologies used
**Database** : MySQL
**Tool** : MySQL Workbench
**Language** : SQL (DDL & DML)

## Database Structure:
## Tables created
Department
Job
Employees

## Key features implemented:
-Primary Key & Foreign Key
-ENUM, CHAR, VARCHAR, FLOAT data types  
 -INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations  
- ALTER TABLE operations  
- Complex `SELECT` queries  
- Pattern matching using `LIKE`  
- Filtering using `IN`, `BETWEEN`, logical operators  
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`  
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses  
- Inner and Outer Joins  
- Nested Subqueries  
- Limiting and Ranking (`LIMIT`)
- Business scenario-based queries (e.g. top earners, department analysis, job-based filtering)

## Learning Outcomes
-Mastery over Relational database design
-Writing complex and optimized SQL queries 
- Applying business logic using SQL
- Data analysis using aggregations, filters, and joins

## How to run this project
1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
2. Copy-paste the SQL script from the `employee_management.sql` file.
3. Run the script step-by-step or all at once to generate the database and tables.
4. Execute individual queries for data manipulation and analysis.

## Sample Query use cases
* HR wants to find top 3 highest-paid employees
* Find average salary per department
* Fetch all employees from a specific department
* Use JOINs to combine department and job data
* Used subqueries to compare salaries dynamically
